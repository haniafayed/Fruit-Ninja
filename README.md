# Fruit-Ninja
 
The game is divided into 2 modes: Classic and Arcade. 

The Classic mode is mainly about slicing fruits that appear on the screen before they fall off the screen. The fruits continuously appear every second, you have to cut as many fruits as you can before they fall. If the fruits fall off-screen you lose lives. 

Initially you have three lives, your lives decrease if you let too many fruits fall or if you slice a dangerous bomb. The game ends if you lose all of your lives or if you slice a fatal bomb. 

There are 3 levels of difficulty in Classic mode: easy, medium and difficult. In easy level, there are a lot of fruits popping up while in medium level, there are more bombs, however, in difficult level, the fruits and bombs move faster.

The more fruits you slice the more the score increases. Every time you play the game and reach a new score you have never reached before it is recorded in the high score. The Arcade mode is mainly about having a timer and you try to slice as much fruits as you can before the timer stops. In addition there are also some special fruits in the 2 modes that boosts your score up like Dragon Fruit and Strawberry.
